It took me a while to get the my OG EgroDox exactly the way I like, but here it is:

Here is the [hex](/assets/firmware.hex) file and a picture, of course:

Things that went through my mind to get here:

* I like the `6` on the left hand side probably becuase I've typed on a [Microsoft Natural Keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_ergonomic_keyboards#/media/File:MicrosoftNaturalKeyboardGen1.jpg) for many many years. Out of habit, I use my left index finger for the `6`.
* I couldn't have the `ESC` key on the top left anymore but it wanted it on the top left of something so I put it on the top left of the right hand side
* I split the arrows keys, Left/Right on the left half on the keyboard and Up/Down on the right so I could easily hit either pair with the `SUPER` modifier on the other hand.
* I chose to have momentary layer shifts only (need to keep a finger on the layer switch key).  This way, I could never get "lost".
