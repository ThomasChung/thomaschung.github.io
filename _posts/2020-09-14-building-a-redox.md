Building a Redox keyboard


First step was 3d printing a case.  I tried a few, but ended up going with the most popular design on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2886662).  I really wanted this [one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3825752) to work, but the 3d printed top plate flexed a little too much for my liking.

Soldered the diodes onto the PCB.  Not too bad.

I'm using Gateron yellow switches here.  My first time using a linear switch.  Ordered from [kbdfans.com](https://kbdfans.com) for super cheap, only $14 for 70.  Shipping kills the deal, though.  Lubed with a 60/40 mix of Superlube grease and oil.  used a 3d printed switch opener (I found this [one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2775085) works the best) and a 3d printed a lubing station.  Yes, the corner of that print lifted off the build plate a little but that didn't affect anything.

Switches all soldered in and tested for continuity with a multimeter.

Here it is, in it's final form:
